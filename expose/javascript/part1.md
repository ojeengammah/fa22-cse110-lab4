1. Line 9 will print “values added: 20”
2. Line 13 will print “final result: 20”
3. line 9 will print “values added: 20”
4. It returns an error becasue "let" exists in the scope where it was declared and limited to the
   scope of a block statement or the epxression it was used. 
5. It retuns an error because the value of const cant be changed through reassignment and nor can it be
   redeclared. 
6. The same applies here as mentioned in question 5 const cant be modified.
